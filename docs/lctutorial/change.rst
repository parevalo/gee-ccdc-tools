Part 1: Submit Change Detection
-------------------------------

Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) is a land change
monitoring that was designed to operate on dense time series of Landsat
data. Until recently, use of CCDC has been limited to high-performance
computing clusters due to the heavy computation requirements. However,
thanks to the outstanding engineers at Google and the US Forest Service,
it is now available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). For a detailed
description of the methodology please refer to:

Zhu, Z., & Woodcock, C. E. (2014). Continuous change detection and
classification of land cover using all available Landsat data. Remote
sensing of Environment, 144, 152-171.

CCDC, as the name implies, has two major components: change detection
and classification. This part of the tutorial will focus on the change
detection component. Spectral change is detected on a pixel level by
testing for structural breaks on the pixel's time series. In GEE, this
process is referred to as 'temporal segmentation', as the pixel-level
time series are segmented according to periods of unique reflectance. It
does so by fitting harmonic regression models to all spectral bands in
the time series. The model-fitting starts at the beginning of the time
series, and moves forward in time in an "online" approach to change
detection. The coefficients are used to predict future observations, and
if the residuals of the future observations exceed a statistical
boundary for numerous consecutive observations then a change is
detected. After the change, a new regression model is fit and the
process continues until the end of the time series.

I am not going to go into all of the details of the algorithm, because
they are explained in the manuscript above. If this is all new to you, I
encourage you to experiment with our CCDC time series viewer app:

https://parevalo-bu.users.earthengine.app/view/quick-tstools

Simply navigate to a location (or choose User Location to navigate to
your current location), pick a Landsat spectral band, and click on the
map to see the CCDC fit to the location you clicked. For example, here
is an example of the SWIR1 time series of a location in Rwanda that was
forest, converted to cropland, and then converted again to a plantation.

In that example, there were two changes detected: one in 2007 and one in
2010. At this point there are no classification labels associated with
the changes, they are simply structural breaks found by the algorithm.
This example is for a single pixel, however, and we wish to perform
analysis over all the pixels in a study region. This tutorial will
demonstrate how to do just that.

CCDC API
~~~~~~~~

To faciliate processing of CCDC mapping on GEE, we have developed an API
that contains functions for generating input data, running CCDC,
filtering the results, creating "synthetic" Landsat imagery, and
classifying the change detection results. The API functions can be found
*here*, and loaded from the following repository:

.. code:: javascript

    var utils = require('users/parevalo_bu/gee-ccdc-tools:ccdcUtilities/api')

Building and image stack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CCDC function in GEE can take any ee.ImageCollection that has been
masked for clouds and cloud shadows. CCDC contains an internal cloud
masking algorithm and is rather robust against missed clouds, but the
cleaner the data the better. If you wish to build your own Image
collection, I refer you to the GEE Examples repo. Alternatively, to
obtain an image collection of Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8 data that is masked
using the cfmask band you can use the 'getLandsat' function in the
'Inputs' module of our api. First, however, we need to define parameters for 
change detection and classification. 

.. code:: javascript

    // Define parameters

    // Change detection parameters
    var changeDetection = {
      breakpointBands: ['GREEN','RED','NIR','SWIR1','SWIR2'],
      tmaskBands: ['GREEN','SWIR2'],
      minObservations: 6,
      chiSquareProbability: .99,
      minNumOfYearsScaler: 1.33,
      dateFormat: 2,
      lambda: 20/10000,
      maxIterations: 25000
    }


    // Classification parameters
    var classification = {
      bandNames: ["B1","B2","B3","B4","B5","B6","B7"],
      inputFeatures: ["INTP", "SLP","PHASE","RMSE"],
      coefs: ["INTP", "SLP","COS", "SIN","RMSE","COS2","SIN2","COS3","SIN3"],
      ancillaryFeatures: ["ELEVATION","ASPECT","DEM_SLOPE","RAINFALL","TEMPERATURE"],
      resultFormat: 'SegCollection',
      classProperty: 'LC_Class',
      yearProperty: 'year',
      classifier: ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest,
      classifierParams: {
        numberOfTrees: 150,
        variablesPerSplit: null,
        minLeafPopulation: 1,
        bagFraction: 0.5,
        maxNodes: null
      },
      outPath: 'projects/GLANCE/RESULTS/CLASSIFICATION/VERSION_1',
      segs: ["S1", "S2", "S3", "S4", "S5", "S6"],
      trainingPath: 'projects/GLANCE/TRAINING/MASTER/NA/NA_V1/NA_Training_Master_V1_NO_LCMAP_2021_03_17',
      trainingPathPredictors: 'projects/GLANCE/TRAINING/MASTER/NA/NA_V1/NA_Training_Master_V1_NO_LCMAP_2021_03_17_predictors',
    }

    var studyRegion = ee.FeatureCollection('USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE/2017')
      .filterMetadata('country_na','equals','Kenya').union()

    var params = {
      start: '2000-01-01',
      end: '2020-01-01',
      ChangeDetection: changeDetection,
      Classification: classification,
      StudyRegion: studyRegion
    }

    // Filter by date and a location in Brazil
    var filteredLandsat = utils.Inputs.getLandsat()
        .filterBounds(params.StudyRegion)
        .filterDate(params.start, params.end)

    print(filteredLandsat.size())

The console should show that there are around images in the collection. It
should be noted that CCDC uses all available Landsat data, even if part
of the image is cloudy! That is because there can be many usable,
cloud-free pixels even if a majority of the image is cloudy. Since CCDC
operates on the pixel time series, those observations are still usable.

Now, we can use this Image Collection into the
ee.Algorithms.TemporalSegmentation.Ccdc algorithm and retrieve a
multi-dimensional array containing model coefficients, model RMSE, and
change information for every detected segment. That means that the
dimensions for one pixel can be different than another, depending on the
number of model breaks. Documentation on the CCDC parameters are in the
GEE Docs, so I will not elaborate on them here.

.. code:: javascript

    params.ChangeDetection['collection'] = filteredLandsat

    var results = ee.Algorithms.TemporalSegmentation.Ccdc(params.ChangeDetection)
    print(results)

And like that, you have run the change detection component of CCDC! A
quick note on the output bands:

-  tStart: The start date of each model segment.
-  tEnd: The end date of each model segment.
-  tBreak: The model break date if a change is detected.
-  numObs: The number of observations used in each model segment.
-  changeProb: A numeric value representing the multi-band change
   probability.
-  \*\_coefs: The regression coefficients for each of the bands in the
   image collection.
-  \*\_rmse: The model root-mean-square error for each segment and input
   band.
-  \*\_magnitude: For segments with changes detected, this represents
   the normalized residuals during the change period.

The array can now be saved as an array image. In my experience, array
images require the 'pyramidingPolicy' to be 'sample'.

The next part of the tutorial we will go through the process of
formatting training data to be used in classification.
